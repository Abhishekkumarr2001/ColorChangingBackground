# ColorChangingBackground

This website is a simple web page that allows you to change the background color dynamically using a button. When you click the "Change Color" button, a random color is generated and set as the background color of the webpage.

The website is designed with a clean and minimalistic layout. The button is styled with a dark background color and white text, providing a clear visual contrast.

The background color transition is smooth and visually pleasing due to the CSS transition property applied to the `<body>` element. When the color changes, it smoothly transitions from the current color to the newly generated color.

The color generation is done using JavaScript, which selects random hexadecimal color codes. This ensures a wide range of colors can be displayed, making each background color change unique and vibrant.

This website can be used for fun, experimentation, or inspiration. It provides an interactive way to explore different color combinations and discover new color palettes. Whether you're looking to find a color scheme for your design project or simply want to have some visual variety, this website offers a quick and easy way to change the background color with just a click of a button.
